#summary DRAFT Validation library
#labels Phase-Design,Type-Library

= Introduction =

Validation is a very common task for web-developers. The purpose of the Validation API is to provide an API that handles the highly repeatable aspects of the validation task, allowing developers to focus on area-specific validations and design. The Validation API should be as data-model agnostic as possible, to make it widely usable.
== Goals ==
  * To provide a simple, extensible API for client data validation
  * To provide implementations for the most commonly needed validations
  * To provide a clean, easy way to create and share third party validations
  * To provide a clean, easy way to create custom validations
