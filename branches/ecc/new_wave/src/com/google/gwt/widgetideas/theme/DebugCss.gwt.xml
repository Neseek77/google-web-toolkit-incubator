PLEASE READ:
This module is NOT intended for production.
Period.
At all.

The prefered way to include incubator css resources is using css resources.
In specific, import the WidgetIdeasCssBundle, then request as many css resources from it that you want.

If you need to use css the old fasioned way, then take all the individual files here and dump them into a single file.
