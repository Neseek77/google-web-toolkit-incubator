 * in that it always has a vertical orientation, and it has no submenus. It also
 * allows for programmatic selection of items in the menu, and programmatically
 * performing the action associated with the selected item. In the MenuBar
 * class, items cannot be selected programatically - they can only be selected
 * when the user places the mouse over a particlar item. Additional methods in
 * SuggestionMenu provide information about the number of items in the menu, and
 * the index of the currently selected item.
