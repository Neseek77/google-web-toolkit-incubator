= Making GWT Incubator Better =
This page explains how to develop with the gwt-incubator source.  

One of the most important things to remember is that gwt-incubator should be compiled against the most current *released* version of GWT. You can download the latest release of GWT for your platform [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/download.html here].
 
== Setting up the incubator project ==

=== Get the source ===
 # Check out the following code from the gwt-incubator Subversion repository:
   # The GWT prerequisite tools and third party library code. Use `gwt/tools` directly if you have them installed. Otherwise download them here:
     {{{~/gwt-incubator$ svn checkout http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/tools/ tools}}}
   # Check out the Incubator source:
     {{{~/gwt-incubator$ svn checkout http://google-web-toolkit-incubator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ trunk-read-only }}}
   # For those of you on a windows platform, we highly recommend the [http://downloads.sourceforge.net/tortoisesvn/TortoiseSVN-1.5.7.15182-win32-svn-1.5.5.msi?download tortoise svn client]. In which case you want:
{{{
  URL of repository: http://google-web-toolkit-incubator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
  Checkout directory: c:\gwt-incubator\trunk (sample path)
}}}


=== Build and test with ant ===

From the incubator directory, type {{{ ant -Dgwt.home=<path to your gwt jar> test }}}

If you are building gwt from source, the gwt.home argument will be something like {{{ -Dgwt.home=/home/you/src/gwt1.5/build/staging/gwt-mac-0.0.0 }}}

=== Setup for Eclipse ===
Use the instructions from the WorkingWithEclipse wiki page.
=== Setup for other IDEs ===
We would much appreciate instructions here, if you are motivated to add them, add them as a comment below and I'll pull them up to this section.

== Contributing to Incubator ==
Before deciding to contribute source code to the incubator project, you should consider the questions below
  # Do you have a signed Google Contributors Agreement(found [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/makinggwtbetter.html#clas here])?
  # Do you believe your source code should become part of the GWT code base?
  # Can you provide sample code, unit tests, and javadoc for the code you wish to submit? 
  # Does your source code work on Internet Explorer, !FireFox, Opera, and Safari? 
  # Are you willing, for the next couple of months following your code submission, to:  
    * Fix all critical bugs in your code
    * Answer outstanding design questions
If the answer to all the questions above is "yes", then your next step is to email 
Google-Web-Toolkit-Contributors@googlegroups.com with the subject line "Looking for Incubator sponsor for _synopsis of code_."

example:
  Looking for Incubator sponsor for DatePicker.

At this point someone who already is a committer to gwt-incubator must be willing to sponsor your code. You will work with the sponsor to get the code in shape for submittal.  You may then petition to become a committer to gwt-incubator.

=== The incubator reference project ===
GWT incubator contains its own reference project. This has a copy of the gwt museum source code.  

This project is right now set up directly for eclipse. To use it:
  # Ensure your gwt-incubator project is named "gwt-incubator" and exports all of its resources.
  # import the project defined in \reference. 
 You should now see a reference project and two launch configs, the `IncubatorMuseum` config includes all visual suites in the reference project. `SingleIssue` is a config to target a single issue, edit the `SingleIssue.gwt.xml` file.
