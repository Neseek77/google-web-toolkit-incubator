#summary What are the current features included in incubator?
 
We are very lucky to have a great group of engineers that contribute to the incubator project, without them none of this could happen.  A special thanks to  Freeland Abbott, Ray Cromwell,Jason Essington, Daniel Florey, John LaBanca, Fred Sauer, Bob Vawter, and Noam Wolf for all their dedicated work.


We have a variety of small widgets peculating in incubator right now,  here are some of the highlights below.
  * DatePicker, a fully internationalized and extensible date picking widget.
  * GlassPanel, exactly what is sounds, very useful to produce translucent effects. 
  * FastTree, a fully customizable tree with a rich event model.
  * SliderBar/ProgressBar/Spinner, A set of really useful widgets to add zazz to your project.
