#summary DRAFT What are the current features included in incubator?
 
We are very lucky to have a great group of engineers that contribute to the incubator project,without them none of this could happen.  A special thanks to  Freeland Abbott, Ray Cromwell, Jason Essington, Daniel Florey,  John Labanca, Fred Sauer, Bob Vawter, and Noam Wolf for all their dedicated work.


We have a variety of small widgets percolating in incubator right now,  we've highlighted some of them below.
  * DatePicker, a fully internationalized and extensible date picking widget.
  * GlassPanel, exactly what is sounds, very useful to produce translucent effects. 
  * FastTree, a fully customizable tree with a rich event model.
  * SliderBar/ProgressBar/Spinner, A set of really useful widgets to add zazz to your project. 
 
We are working of a full [Tables gwt table suite], which include:
  * bulk rendering of tables(up to 10x faster then normal rendering)
  * scrolling tables, where the footer and header are fixed
  * paging tables, where the table can page through arbitrary data sets
  * editable tables, complete with common cell editors.
 
We have a complete [Logging gwt logging] system as well, it includes
  * logging levels based on java's logging system
  * categories and filters to narrow
  * compilation options so logging can be completely removed or minimally included for production mode.
  * a variety of default logging handler that output to everything from firebug to a GWT tree widget.

For those of you that use css  heavily, you know the trade-offs between readable and modular CSS and css that is actually fast and efficient to download. With CssResource your css source files can be fully commented and modulized, because in production all those files will be stripped of comments, whitespace, and aggregated into your single html file.
