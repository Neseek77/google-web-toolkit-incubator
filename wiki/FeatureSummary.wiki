#summary DRAFT What are the current features included in incubator?
 
We are very lucky to have a great group of engineers that contribute to the incubator project,without them none of this could happen.  A special thanks to  Freeland Abbott, Ray Cromwell, Jason Essington, Daniel Florey,  John Labanca, Fred Sauer, Bob Vawter, and Noam Wolf for all their dedicated work.


We have a variety of small widgets percolating in incubator right now,  we've highlighted some of them below.
  * DatePicker, a fully internationalized and extensible date picking widget.
  * GlassPanel, exactly what is sounds, very useful to produce translucent effects. 
  * FastTree, a fully customizable tree with a rich event model.
  * SliderBar/ProgressBar/Spinner, A set of really useful widgets to add zazz to your project. 
 
We are working of a full [Tables gwt table suite], which include:
  * bulk rendering of tables(up to 10x faster then normal rendering)
  * scrolling tables, where the footer and header are fixed
  * paging tables, where the table can page through arbitrary data sets
  * editable tables, complete with common cell editors.
 
We have a complete [Logging gwt logging suite] as well, it includes
  * logging levels based on java's logging system
  * categories and filters to narrow logging output
  * a native java mode for shared code, where the output can be intagrated with your server logging system
  * compilation options so logging can be completely removed or minimally included for production mode
  * a variety of default logging handler that output to everything from firebug to a GWT tree widget

For those of you that use css  heavily, you know the trade-offs between readable/modular `css` and `css` that is efficient to download. With CssResource your `css` source files can be fully commented and modulized, because in production all those files will be stripped of comments, whitespace, and aggregated into your single html file.
