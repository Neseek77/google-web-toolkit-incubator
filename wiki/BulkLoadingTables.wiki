#summary Bulk loading tables: `BulkLoadedTable` and `PreloadedTable`

= Introduction =
For those that need every last millisecond of speed for table manipulation, we have introduced BulkLoadedTable and PreloadedTable.

A `BulkLoadedTable` uses a `TableModel` to load its data.  

After being loaded, widgets, cell spans, row spans etc. may be added to the table, but there will be no speed advantage for them.

A `PreloadedTable` is simply a wrapper around a `BulkLoadedTable` that allows programmers to use the familiar declarative API and still get some of the speed advantages of the `BulkLoadedTable`.
 
Here are some comparison numbers for a 120 X 15 row table.
