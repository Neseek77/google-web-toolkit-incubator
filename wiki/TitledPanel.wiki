#summary New Widget - A bordered panel that displays a titled over the upper left corner of the border.

= Introduction =
The TitledPanel is an extension of the SimplePanel that wraps its contents in a titled border.  The title appears right over the border in the upper left corner.  This is a wrapper class for the fieldset HTML element.

Example:

= CSS =

Here is an example CSS style for the TitledPanel Widget:
{{{
/**
 * Applied to the title of the TitledPanel.
 */
fieldset legend {
  color: blue;
}
}}}

Even without CSS, the TitledPanel looks cool.  However, IE automatically colors the title blue, so I suggest you manually specify a color so it is consistent across all browsers.


= Sample Code =

{{{
  HTML contents = new HTML("This is a widget in the TitledPanel");
  TitledPanel panel = new TitledPanel("Title Goes Here", contents);
}}}
