Set the class-path var `GWT_HOME` to point to the directory containing the gwt jars you want to use.
Set the linked resource `GWT_TOOLS` to point to the gwt or gwt incubator tools dir you want to use.

= Step three =
import the `gwt-incubator-resources` project.  If you are on windows, import it from `\eclipse\incubator-resources-windows`. If you are in linux import it from `\eclipse\incubator-resources-linux`, if you on mac, well, you get the idea.

import the new eclipse project from the root of your trunk.
