[http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/source/browse/trunk/eclipse/README.txt Follow the GWT eclipse setup instructions] 

Also, you probably want the [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ subeclipse project] as well.

= Step two  =
Set the following classpath variables
||`GWT_HOME`|| set to the directory containing the gwt jars you want to use||
||`GWT_TOOLS`|| set to the gwt-incubator tools directory||
 
Set the classpath
= Step three =
import the `gwt-incubator-resources` project.  These paths are are relative to your project's root, so, for example a typical root would be `c:\gwt-incubator\trunk\`.
||Windows||`\eclipse\incubator-resources-windows`||
||Linux||`\eclipse\incubator-resources-linux`||
||Mac||`\eclipse\incubator-resources-mac`||
