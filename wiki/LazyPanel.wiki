= Details =
By default, the LazyPanel is not displayed. Only when `setVisible(true)` is called on the LazyPanel is the underlying widget created. 

This class primarily should be used in conjunction with `StackPanel`, `DisclosurePanel`, and `TabPanel` when the child panels contain relatively heavy weight contents. Using LazyPanel to wrap the creation of those contents can significantly improve user experience.
