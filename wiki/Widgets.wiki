#summar Overview of Incubator Widgets

= Introduction =
The widgets package is meant for widgets that are candidates for a later GWT release.  All widgets are available using the  `Widgets' module file. To use it, include the following line into your module file:
{{{<inherits name='com.google.gwt.widgetideas.WidgetIdeas'/>}}}

Note, new widgets are now being introduced in the gen2 package instead.
