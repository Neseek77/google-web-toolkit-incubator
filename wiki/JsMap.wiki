#summary DRAFT The JsMap library

= Design Principles =
Here are the design principles for the js Map library.
  * Must be as fast and have the smallest memory footprint as possible, even if that leads to an uglier API.
  * Code size should be kept small.
  * "put" speed optimized over "get" speed, as "puts" tend to happen at program initialization.
  * If we need to use a different implementation in hosted mode, that decision should be transparent to the users.
  * Should have well understood constraints for key/value values.
  * API should be easy to use.
